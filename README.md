# Midterm-PIT-Webpage
The Mock-up USTP Page layout (MIDYEAR Midterm PIT)

NOTE:
I EDITED THIS WEBPAGE WITHOUT BOOTSTRAP YET BECAUSE I JUST LEARNED ABOUT BOOTSTRAP 
AND WHAT ITS SIGNIFICANTS TO THE FRONTEND WEB DEVELOPMENT. AND WHENEVER I APPLY THE BOOTSTRAP LINKS,
IT'LL MESS UP THE MARGINS AND THE SPACINGS WITH THE STRUCTURED LAYOUTS.
ADN I ALSO EDITED THIS WEBPAGE WITH THE MICROSOFT EDGE AS THE DEFAULT BROWSER AND THE TAB IS ON 50% ZOOMED OUT,
I HAVENT LOOKED UP THE OTHER TAGS YET AND I HAVENT EXPLORED DEEPER ENUF INTO THE HTML 
AND CSS WITH ALL ITS OTHER ELEMENTS. ILL CONTINUE TO IMPORVE THIS PAGE REAL SOON.
